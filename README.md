## Description

This project is made using create-react-app as boilerplate and react-router-dom for implementing some routing behaviour.<br />
I have to confess that, this implementation is not the best approach to take. <br />
I just tought that you would like to see core skills of react, that is why I didn't use
extra libraries like redux (to manage state in one place), react-window (to render only visible items in the list to the DOM), lodash (improve mapping and filtering), prop-types (to check provided props types), framer-motion (for animations) etc.<br />

It took for me about 10 hours to complete this project and most of the time went to writing CSS. I usually use SASS so it was quite painful for me to write vanilla CSS, there was a lot of repeating myself :)<br />

I think i could do better if I could use these extra libraries to simplify code and make this application friendly to other developers as well. For now, i hope that requested functionality is present and I hope that you appreciate the effort :)

## Improvements

To improve accessibility i would make some of the components reusable (like buttons etc.)<br />
Setting up Redux to manage state internally. Ofcourse there is also context system in React but i didn't use it for this project.<br/>
Seperating reusable functionality to another files (hooks) would also be good idea. <br />
